  \param desc This text will be used in the Touch Portal interface to represent the new state (optional if you don't need it selectable in TP UI).
  \param defaultValue An optional default value for the state, meaning it's initial value.

  Note that if you do not want/need a state to be available in the UI, then any `stateUpdateById()` call will also work (the state will be created if needed but not accessible via the UI).

  Sends a connector (slider) update with given `value` which should be an integer in the range of 0 - 100.
  The `shortId` should be a Touch Portal "short connector ID" as reported by Touch Portal in `shortConnectorIdNotification` messages.

  These IDs can be looked up using `TP.getShortConnectorIds()` method. Another option is to subscribe to the `TP.connectorIdsChanged()` event
  and track any reported connectors that way. Another, somewhat slower, option is to retrieve a list of reported short IDs with `TP.getConnectorRecords()`
  and further process the result(s) to find the connector(s) you're looking for.

  Note that is also possible to find these short IDs in the source JSON of a Touch Portal page (.tml file). Not recommended, but it can do in a pinch.

  The `connectorId` must be fully qualified "long ID" as described in Touch Portal [API docs](https://www.touch-portal.com/api/index.php?section=connectors).

  This method could in theory be used to update sliders with connectors provided by other plugins. In practice it is fairly limited since the full `connectorId`
  must be 200 characters or less, and coming up with those IDs in the first place can be challenging. However you may find some use for it after all.

  \ingroup TPAPI
  \memberof TP
  \static
  Creates or raises a user notification in the Touch Portal window. See TP API docs for details on notifications.
  \param notificationId should be a unique string, if the user has already responded to a notification with the same `notificationId` then nothing will be shown.
  \param title This will be shown at the top of the notification window.
  \param message This is the body of the notification, the main text.
  \param options This is an optional array of "choice" objects which are presented in the notification for user to click on. For example:
    ```js
    [
      {
        "id":"option1",
        "title":"Option 1 title"
      },
      {
        "id":"option2",
        "title":"Option 2 title"
      }
    ]
    ```
  \param callback A callback to invoke when one of the options is clicked. The callback value can be a string, function, or an array.
  - A string type callback is simply evaluated (`eval(callback)`). There is no way to pass any arguments to this.
  - A function is called with the clicked option's `id` as the first argument and the `notificationId` as the second argument.
  - If an array is given, the first member of the array should be a function and the 2nd argument should be the `this` context with which
    to invoke the callback function. The function is invoked with the same arguments as described above.

  \name Events
  \ingroup TPAPI
  These are events which are raised whenever some kind of data update is received from Touch Portal.
  Events may pass one or more parameters to callback handlers (check documentation for specific events).
  There are two syntactical ways to connect a callback function to an event.

  First is by using the usual 'on*' style syntax:
  ```js
  TP.oneventName( (parameters) => { .... } );
  ```
  The other way is with the `connect()` event prototype method:
  ```js
  TP.eventName.connect( (parameters) => { .... } );
  ```

  Both forms have a 2-parameter version which allows a context object to be given, which then becomes the "this" object when the event handler callback is executed.
  ```js
  MyObject.prototype.myHandler = function(parameters) { ... }
  const myObject = new MyObject();
  TP.oneventName(myObject.myHandler, myObject);
  // OR  (note the switched parameter order)
  TP.eventName.connect(myObject, myObject.myHandler);
  ```

/*!
  \fn void broadcastEvent(String event, Object data)
  \memberof TP
  \ingroup TPAPI
  \static
  This event is emitted when Touch Portal sends a `broadcast` message to all plugins.
  The `event` parameter is the name of the event type.
  - As of TP v3.1 (API v6) this can only be "pageChange" to signify that a user has navigated to a new page on their Touch Portal device (_not_ in the desktop page editor).

  The `data` contains any further information about the event.
  - For the `pageChange` event there is one member named `pageName` which holds the name of the newly selected page. The name may contain a "path"
    if the page is in side a subfolder.  For example "(main)" or "games/MSFS".

  You can connect to this event as described in the overall event documentation above, with either `onbroadcastEvent()` or `broadcastEvent.connect()` syntax.

  \note Touch Portal v3.2 is going to have a multi-device upgrade available, so multiple devices could be connected to one
  desktop application and have different pages open.  It's not clear yet how this will affect the "pageChange" broadcast event.

/*!
  \fn void connectorIdsChanged(String instanceName, String shortId)
  \memberof TP
  \ingroup TPAPI
  \static
  This event is emitted whenever a `shortConnectorIdNotification` message from Touch Portal has been received, parsed, and added to the tracking database.

  The first parameter passed to event handlers is the State Name used in the connector which has been added/modified. Note that for all "Anonymous (One-Time)"
  type connectors the `instanceName` will always be "ANONYMOUS".

  The second parameter is the `shortId` of this slider instance as created by Touch Portal. This short ID can be used later to send updates back
  to this slider.

  You can connect to this event as described in the overall event documentation above, with either `onconnectorIdsChanged()` or `connectorIdsChanged.connect()` syntax.

/*!
  \name Connector Data
  \ingroup TPAPI
  Touch Portal reports connector instances to the plugin via `shortConnectorIdNotification` messages. These messages are parsed and logged
  into a database. The functions in this group can be used to query the data based on various criteria about logged connectors.
  The connector short IDs can then be used to send updates back to Touch Portal, which will move the corresponding slider(s) into a particular position.

/*!
  \fn Array<String> getConnectorShortIds(Object criteria = {})
  \ingroup TPAPI
  \memberof TP
  \static
  Returns zero or more connector "short IDs" based on the given `criteria` from the currently logged connector notification data.

  `criteria` is an object that can contain any of the properties of `ConnectorRecord` (unless explicitly documented otherwise).
  For most properties wildcard patterns can be used in the values (again, check `ConnectorRecord` documentation for details on each property).

  For example, to find a Slider instance short ID for a connector with which loads a "example.mjs" module script and invokes a "run()" function
  with any parameters:
  ```js
  const shortIds = TP.getConnectorShortIds({ file: "*example.mjs", expression: "run(*)" });
  ```

  Wildcards are typical "GLOB" style: `*` for "match anything", `?` for "any one character", or `[xyz]` to match any of a set of characters.

  As noted in the `ConnectorRecord` documentation, some enumeration type properties can only be matched by their full value, like `ConnectorRecord.actionType`.

  If `criteria` is empty/null/undefined, then _all_ connector records currently in the database will be returned.

  By default the results are sorted by newest first, that is by the `timestamp` property in descending (largest first) order. To specify a custom
  sort order, add the special property `orderBy` to the search `criteria`. The value of `orderBy` can be the name of any of the `ConnectorRecord` properties,
  optionally followed by `ASC` or `DESC` to specify the ordering for ascending (smaller first) or descending (largest first), respectively.
  Default is ascending order ("ASC"). Multiple properties can also be specified by separating them with a comma.

  For example to find a all sliders for the current engine instance by State Name, sorted by oldest first and then by expression value in reverse alphabetical order:
  ```js
  const shortIds = TP.getConnectorShortIds({ instanceName: DSE.INSTANCE_NAME, orderBy: "timestamp ASC, expression DESC" });
  ```

  \fn Array<ConnectorRecord> getConnectorRecords(Object criteria = {})
  \memberof TP
  \ingroup TPAPI
  \static
  Returns zero or more `ConnectorRecord` objects based on the given `criteria` from the currently logged connector notification data.

  `criteria` is exactly the same as described for `getConnectorShortIds()` function, above.

  The only difference here is that the results include the whole `ConnectorRecord` object, instead of just the `shortId` property.  The objects can then be
  further examined as needed. Keep in mind these are all read-only results.

/*!
  \fn ConnectorRecord getConnectorByShortId(String shortId)
  \memberof TP
  \ingroup TPAPI
  \static
  Returns a `ConnectorRecord` based on the given `shortId` from the currently logged connector notification data, if any.
  If no matching record is found, the returned `ConnectorRecord` will be empty/null, which can be checked with `ConnectorRecord.isNull` property.

  Short IDs are unique, so each one identifies a unique slider instance. This function could be particularly useful with the `TP.connectorIdsChanged()` event
  to get more information about the new slider short ID which is passed by that event to handlers as the 2nd parameter.

  You _can_ use a wildcard pattern in the `shortId` parameter, as described in previous documentation about search criteria. However this query will
  always return only one record.  If the wildcard pattern matches multiple records, only the newest one (by `timestamp`) will be returned.

  \note There is currently no method in Touch Portal's API for determining that a slider/connector with a given short ID still actually exists on a user's page.

  Returns the name of the page the user last opened on their Touch Portal device (_not_ in the desktop page editor).
  This is always the result of the last `broadcastEvent()`'s `pageName` property. See `broadcastEvent()` documentation for details.

  \note Touch Portal does _not_ send this event to a plugin when it starts up, only once an actual page change happens the first time.
    As a result, the result of this function call may be empty until the user has switched pages on their device.
